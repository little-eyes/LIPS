This project is an implementation of a link quality prediction algorithm used in wireless sensor networks. We use State-Space model to describe the link channel's quality, say RSSI and LQI values. Then we predict the next time's quality.

The prediction result is super cool! For more details, you can go to:

It covers two parts: emulation and in-field testing. The emulation is to validate the model and the in-field testing is implemented on LiteOS 2.0.
